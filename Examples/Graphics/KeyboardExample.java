  /* What to do when a key is released. For this example program, we aren't
     putting anything in here, although I recommend that you experiment with
     it - try moving all of the code from the keyPressed method in here
     instead and see how differently your program controls.

  /* What to do when a key is typed - this means when your operating system
     determines that a Unicode character has been entered. We use a different
     method here - getKeyChar() instead of getKeyCode().
     For example, if the A key is pressed, without the shift key being held
     down or the caps lock being on, then e.getKeyChar() would produce the
     character 'a'. If the 7 key is pressed with the shift key held, then
     e.getKeyChar() would produce the character '&'.
     
     Generally, unless you want the user to be able to type text, this method
     is not as useful as the other two, and so we will rarely if ever use it
     in this example series.

/* Explanation of the implements keyword:
     If A implements B, then A must contain all of the methods specified in B.
       (Here, A is a class, and B is a list of method prototypes called an
        'interface'. A 'method prototype' is the first line of the method
        defining its name, inputs, and outputs, among other things. Example:
          public static void main(String[] args) is the prototype for main.
     
     In exchange, we get to use A as if it were of type B. A class can only
     extend one class, but it can implement any number of interfaces. This is
     useful because it allows us to fit an object with custom behavior into an
     existing framework of method calls.
     
     In this particular case, a KeyListener is an object that looks for and
     responds to key actions (key presses, releases, and types). We could
     create a separate object to serve this purpose, but here we've actually
     done a bit of a 'hacky' solution to use the KeyboardExample class as its
     own KeyListener. This is why we get the following weird line:
     
       addKeyListener(this);
     
     This line calls the addKeyListener method from the JPanel class, which
     takes in a KeyListener object and routes keyboard input to that object
     whenever a key action occurs while this JPanel is active. The word
     'this' refers to the current object, since we are using it as its own
     KeyListener.
