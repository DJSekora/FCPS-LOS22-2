/* This class contains even more improvements over BetterKeyboardExample.java.

   We once again change the way input works, to give us more control over how
   we respond to those inputs within the main loop.
   
   To see a big difference, try doing the following simple experiment with both
   this program and BetterKeyboardExample.java:
     Hold down the RIGHT arrow key on the keyboard.
     Keeping the RIGHT key held down, keep pressing and releasing the LEFT
     arrow key and observe the behavior of the square.
     Which program does a better job of producing the expected results?
   
   See AccelerationExample.java for a few small changes to this paradigm that
   allow us to model physics at a more accurate level (introducing
   acceleration)
   
   After that, take a look at CollisionExample to see how we can add collision
   with walls and onscreen entities.
