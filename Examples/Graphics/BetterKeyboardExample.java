/* This class contains some small improvements over the KeyboardExample class.

   We do a pretty good job of correcting some of the flaws, but there's still
   room for more improvement. See EvenBetterKeyboardExample.java for the next
   upgrade!
   
   MAKE SURE TO CALL panel.mainLoop() AT THE END OF THE MAIN METHOD FROM
   GraphicsMainExample.java.
   
   The main addition from KeyboardExample: We have combined the mainLoop idea
   from the AnimationExample with the keyboard movement. Instead of changing
   the position directly when a key is pressed, we just change the speed. The
   position changes inside a loop - every 20 milliseconds, the loop checks the
   xSpeed and ySpeed of the square and moves it accordingly.
   Advantages:  
     + Creates smoother movement,
     + removes dependency on how fast your operating system spams key presses,
       and also
     + allows us to reliably move diagonally

     Notice how this has the same 3 parts as the animation loop:
      1. Change some variable(s) representing information about what to draw
         as needed,
      2. Wait a fixed amount of time to keep a consistent frame rate,
      3. Redraw the screen,
