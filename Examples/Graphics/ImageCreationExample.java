/* Sometimes, we want to draw something more complicated than a series of
   rectangles, ovals, Strings, lines, and polygons.
   
   At times like these, we can work at the pixel level! This COULD be
   accomplished by calling drawRect over and over again with 1x1 rectangles,
   but it's more efficient to just modify the pixel values of an image and
   then make one drawImage call. This has the additional advantage that we
   only have to create the image one time, so we don't have to worry as much
   about optimizing the image creation process.
