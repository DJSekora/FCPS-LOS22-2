/* Comments are extremely useful tools for writing readable and maintainble
   code. It's good practice to begin each code file with a block comment
   describing what the code does, who wrote the code, how to run or use the
   code, etc..

   Within the code ("inline"), it's good to write comments explaining anything
   that you wouldn't understand if you came back to it 2 months later.
   
   This helps make your code understandable to other people reading your code,
   such as teammates, bosses, and teachers!
